Task 11: Download Roles From an Ansible Galaxy and Use Them

Use Ansible Galaxy to download and install geerlingguy.haproxy role in /home/automation/plays/roles.

Create a playbook /home/automation/plays/haproxy.yml that runs on servers in the proxy host group and does the following:

Use geerlingguy.haproxy role to load balance request between hosts in the webservers host group.
Use roundrobin load balancing method.
HAProxy backend servers should be configured for HTTP only (port 80).
Firewall is configured to allow all incoming traffic on port TCP 80.
If your playbook works, then doing “curl http://ansible2.hl.local/” should return output from the web server (see task #10). Running the command again should return output from the other web server.
