Task 18. Create and Use Templates to Create Customised Configuration Files

Create a playbook /home/automation/plays/server_list.yml that does the following:

Playbook uses a Jinja2 template server_list.j2 to create a file /etc/server_list.txt on hosts in the database host group.
The file /etc/server_list.txt is owned by the automation user.
File permissions are set to 0600.
SELinux file label should be set to net_conf_t.
The content of the file is a list of FQDNs of all inventory hosts.
After running the playbook, the content of the file /etc/server_list.txt should be the following:

ansible2.hl.local
ansible3.hl.local
ansible4.hl.local
ansible5.hl.local
Note: if the FQDN of any inventory host changes, re-running the playbook should update the file with the new values.
