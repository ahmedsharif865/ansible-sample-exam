Task 2: Ad-Hoc Commands

Generate an SSH keypair on the control node. You can perform this step manually.

Write a script /home/automation/plays/adhoc that uses Ansible ad-hoc commands to achieve the following:

User automation is created on all inventory hosts.
SSH key (that you generated) is copied to all inventory hosts for the automation user and stored in /home/automation/.ssh/authorized_keys.
The automation user is allowed to elevate privileges on all inventory hosts without having to provide a password.
After running the adhoc script, you should be able to SSH into all inventory hosts using the automation user without password, as well as a run all privileged commands.
