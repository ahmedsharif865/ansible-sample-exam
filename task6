Create a playbook /home/automation/plays/users.yml that uses the vault file /home/automation/plays/secret.yml to achieve the following:

Users whose user ID starts with 1 should be created on servers in the webservers host group. User password should be used from the user_password variable.
Users whose user ID starts with 2 should be created on servers in the database host group. User password should be used from the user_password variable.
All users should be members of a supplementary group wheel.
Shell should be set to /bin/bash for all users.
Account passwords should use the SHA512 hash format.
Each user should have an SSH key uploaded (use the SSH key that you created previously, see task #2).
After running the playbook, users should be able to SSH into their respective servers without passwords.
